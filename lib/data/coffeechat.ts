Hello <@${user1}> and <@${user2}>!

I'm your friendly neighborhood :robot_face:, here to help you get to know your teammates by pairing everyone on a weekly basis! 

Anyway, now that you're here, why don't you pick a time to meet for :coffee:, :tea:, :hamburger:, or :doughnut:s? Make sure you take quality, wholesome pictures to post in <#CDXU35346>!

_Not interested? You can opt out of future pairings by leaving the <#${channelID}> channel._`;
